# Discrete Electronics Lab

A collection of electronics experiments using only a battery and basic components, **no microcontrollers**. Just pure hardware: logic gates, timers, displays.

This repository is meant to explore and document small projects that demonstrate fundamental concepts in digital and analog electronics.

## Experiments:
| Project | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| [`binary-to-decimal-display`](./binary-to-decimal-display) | Convert 5-bit binary input into decimal and display it using two 7-segment displays—fully built from logic chips. |
| [`binary-to-decimal-display-2nd-option`](./binary-to-decimal-display-2nd-option) | Simpler option to convert 5-bit binary input into decimal |


## Goals
- Use only discrete components: logic ICs, transistors, resistors, capacitors, etc.
- Focus on understanding how circuits work at the signal level
- Avoid microcontrollers
