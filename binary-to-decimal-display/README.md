# 5-Bit Binary to Decimal Display (No Microcontrollers)

This is a simple hardware project that turns a 5-bit binary number into a decimal output using 74-series logic chips. It uses a basic binary-to-BCD conversion to drive three 7-segment displaysâ€”no microcontrollers, no firmware, just plain old logic gates. 

Built mainly for fun and learning, it was a way to dive deeper into electronics and explore what can be made without relying on code. 

It was surprisingly fascinating to implement what seemed like a "simple" algorithm entirely in hardware.


## What This Does

- Takes a 5-bit binary input from DIP switch
- Using **74-series logic chips**
- Outputs the corresponding decimal number using 2 **7-segment displays** 

---

## Why I Built It

- Practice using logic gates and 74-series chips
- Avoid relying on microcontrollers or pre-programmed solutions
- Build something tangible and satisfying just using logic and a battery

## Components I Used

- 74-series logic chips, I used only AND, OR and NOT
- Voltage Regulator LM7805
- 2 x 7-segment display decoder (like 74LS47)
- 2 x 7-segment displays
- DIP switches (5 bits)
- 2 Capacitors - 47ÂµF, 0.1ÂµF
- Resistors (see steps)
- Breadboard and jumper wires
- Battery 9V and allegators clips
- Optional: LEDs and Multimeter for debug and testing

## How It Works
 Based on the 5-bit input from the DIP switch, the circuit uses logic gates to generate two outputs:s:
  - 2-bit output for the **tens** place. This goes into a small logic circuit that converts it into BCD and sends it to a 7-segment display
  - 4-bit output for the **units** place, which is connected to a 74LS47 BCD-to-7-segment driver and another display.

## Steps

### 1. Connect Voltage regulator  

Before connecting anything else, it's important to make sure the voltage is right. Most 74-series chips require a stable 5V DC supply. If you're using a 9V battery (like I did), you'll need a voltage regulator to step it down to 5V, you risk burning out the chips.

I used an **LM7805** voltage regulator. Here's how to wire it:

- **Pin 1** â†’ Input: connect to the 9V battery  
- **Pin 2** â†’ Ground: connect to GND  
- **Pin 3** â†’ Output: this will give you 5V

To stabilize the voltage I added two capacitors:
- A **47ÂµF** capacitor between Pin 1 and GND  
- A **0.1ÂµF** capacitor between Pin 3 and GND

After wiring it up, use a multimeter to check the output. It should read close to 5V before powering any of your logic chips.

> Note: If you're using a regulated bench power supply set to 5V, you can skip the voltage regulator.

### 2. Connect 5-bit DIP Switch

I'm not sure if standalone 5-bit DIP switches exist, so I used a combination of a 4-bit and a 1-bit switch. Each switch is wired as follows:

- One side of each switch is connected to **5V**  
- The other side is connected to the **input pins** of the logic circuit  
- Each input is also pulled down to **GND** using **15kÎ© resistors**, to ensure a clear LOW state when the switch is off  
- Add jumper wires from each switch output and plug them into empty breadboard rows for now, or you can add the LEDs tempporary to test.

### 3. Connect BCD logic and 7-segment displays  

On a separate breadboard, connect the **74LS47** and the **7-segment display**. There are plenty of datasheets online for both components if you need pinouts.
Donâ€™t forget to add **current-limiting resistors** for each segment of the displayâ€”values between **220Î© and 470Î©** work well, depending on brightness.

For testing, connect the **A, B, C, and D** inputs of the 74LS47 to either **GND or 5V** manually, and play around with different binary combinations. This is a good way to confirm that the correct numbers are being shown on the display before wiring it up to the rest of the logic circuit.

### 4. Wiring the First Digit (Tens Place)

Since I couldnâ€™t figure out how to cleanly use a 2-digit 7-segment display (if you know how, feel free to DM me!), I went with a simple solution: use one display for the **tens** and another for the **units**.

Because the input is only 5 bits (values 0â€“31), the tens digit will only ever be 0, 1, 2, or 3. In binary, that means:

0000  
0001  
0010  
0011

So, the `D` and `C` inputs of the 74LS47 connected to the tens display will **always be 0**, and you can connect them directly to GND.

#### Logic for Input B (of 74LS47)

Looking at the binary values from 10 to 31:
from 10 to 31:
```
Dec   E D C B A
10    0 1 0 1 0
11    0 1 0 1 1
12    0 1 1 0 0
...
29    1 1 1 0 1
30    1 1 1 1 0
31    1 1 1 1 1
```
we can split the conditions for `B` into two main cases:

- From **10 to 15**: when `E = 0`, `D = 1`, and `B` or `C` is high  
- From **16 to 31**: when `E = 1`, and either `D = 0` or `B = 0`

That gives us the logic formula:

`B = (!E âˆ§ D âˆ§ (B âˆ¨ C)) âˆ¨ (E âˆ§ (!D âˆ¨ !B))`

#### Logic for Input A (of 74LS47)

This oneâ€™s a bit more complex. The input `A` should be high in three ranges:

- From **10 to 15**: `E = 0`, `D = 1`, and `B` or `C` is high      => `!E âˆ§ D âˆ§ (B âˆ¨ C)`
- From **16 to 19**: `E = 1`, `D = 0`, `C = 0`                     => `E âˆ§ !D âˆ§ !C`
- For **30 and 31**: `E = 1`, `D = 1`, `C = 1`, and `B = 1`        => `E âˆ§ D âˆ§ C âˆ§ B`

So the full logic expression is:

`A = (!E âˆ§ D âˆ§ (B âˆ¨ C)) âˆ¨ (E âˆ§ !D âˆ§ !C) âˆ¨ (E âˆ§ D âˆ§ C âˆ§ B)`

#### Gate Usage & Layout

To build this with basic gates, I used:
- 2 AND gates  
- 1 OR gate  
- 1 NOT gate  

I placed some gates (like an AND and a NOT) in the middle of the board so they could be reused by the second digit logic later. The final OR gate was placed next to the 74LS47, since thatâ€™s where the result is fed into.
